	<p> Hi everyone! I'm Moira from Mandaluyong City. <sup>1</sup>
	I'm 20 years old and currently studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of the East Manila. <sup>2</sup>
	One of the greatest blessing that I received during my childhood was my mom gave birth to me. <sup>3</sup>
	As well as having my supportive parents and sibling with me. <sup>4</sup>
	Well, during my childhood years I only spent my time watching cartoons, playing games with my friends like chinese garter, 
	jumping ropes, hopscotch and etc. <sup>5</sup>
	I remembered waking up in the morning drinking hot milo and bread and watching doraemon on tv. <sup>6</sup>
	I also remembered sleeping late just to watch "Rugratz" in Nickelodeon me and my sister waited for 12 AM just to watch it. <sup>7</sup>
	I was also fond of F4 from the Taiwanese Drama Meteor Garden. <sup>8</sup>
	My mom and aunt told me that I was a bit obsessed with them like I'm saying that they are my boyfriends and I find it funny as I think 
	of it today. <sup>9</sup>
	Moving on when I was in Grade School specifically in the 2nd grade I tried ballet. <sup>10</sup> 
	I joined in a play which is inspired by one of Barbie's movies which is the "12 Dancing Princesses". <sup>11</sup>
	I enjoyed performing on stage hence, I didn't further pursued dancing to ballet. <sup>12</sup>
	After that I took a summer dance class in St. Therese because they were offering a dance class, I also took computer classes.<sup>13</sup>
	There I learned about the floppy disk, the disk drive, the parts of a computer and etc. <sup>14</sup>
	I also tried moving files in the floppy disk, thinking of those ways felt like I wanna go back to the past. <sup>15</sup>
	I also experienced dancing on stage it was a completio program of the dance class. <sup>16</sup>
	I was really nervous at that time, and I still remembered that I was happy because I know I did my best.<sup>17</sup>
	I think I was in the age of 10 or 11 that time, yet I already danced on stage and I'm really happy witht that. <sup>18</sup>
	And as I reminisce about it I can say that eversince I was young I'm really into dancing. <sup>19</sup> 
	Those years was one of the memorable memories that I will cherish and keep forever. <sup>20</sup>

	<p> Wayback during my junior high school and senior high school, I'm a quiet shy girl. <sup>1</sup>
	I just wanted to finish my studies already. <sup>2</sup>
	I didn't have a lot of friends since I'm shy to socialize with them. <sup>3</sup>
	Yet some people still tried to approached me and I tried to socialize because "No man is an island." <sup>4</sup>
	No matter how I tried to be alone, at the end of the day I'll still need someone right by my side. <sup>5</sup>
	And because of that I had 2 group of friends, one is when I was in JHS and the second one is when I was in SHS. <sup>6</sup>
	My SHS friends helped me to change like in my physical and mental. <sup>7</sup>
	They encouraged me to be a diligent student because back in the JHS I was a really lazy person. <sup>8</sup>
	And because of that I graduated SHS with honors, I'm really thankful for having them as a part of my life. <sup>9</sup>
	Hence, since I was studying in an all girls school I was a bit awkward socializing around guys. <sup>10</sup>
	So I need to make some adjustments due to the fact that this world isn't full of girls, it also has boys. <sup>11</sup>
	Whether I like it or not, I'll still end up socializing with guys. <sup>12</sup>
	During the year 2017 where it all changes, I pursued dancing to korean choreography. <sup>13</sup>
	I formed a dance cover group hence, after our group debuted the members became inactive. <sup>14</sup>
	So I decided to join to one of those who are looking for members and it is where I met my new friends, or should I say one of the best 
	of friends that I met. <sup>15</sup>
	Up until now we still hang out. <sup>16</sup>
	That year is also where I met my boyfriend, we both had the same passion for dancing. <sup>17</sup>
	We both supported our own groups as we perform on stage. <sup>18</sup>
	And it was the biggest twist in my life. <sup>19</sup>
	As I said awhile ago during my childhood I was really into dancing and during my teenage years I go forward to pursue it. <sup>20</sup>
	Because of dancing I gained my confidence, I gained true friends, I became happy with my life, both having my supportive family and 
	friends. <sup>21</sup>
	As I think of it, it was just like yesterday when all this happened. <sup>22</sup>
	Time flies really fast, I need to seize every moment. <sup>23</sup>

	<p> Today, my college years studying at University of the East Manila. <sup>1</sup>
	A sophomore studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. <sup>2</sup>
	Although I took a business strand when I was in SHS. <sup>3</sup>
	I chose the course of BSCS instead of choosing Tourism as my course. <sup>4</sup>
	When I was 15 years old, I always loved to be one of the flight attendant. <sup>5</sup>
	Hence in today even though you don't study the course Tourism you can still be a flight attendant. <sup>6</sup>
	Practically thinking I went on another road which is chosing this BSCS course. <sup>7</sup>
	And I'm happy that I studied in this school because I met new and real friends. <sup>8</sup>
	As I see it we all have the same personalities. <sup>9</sup>
	I'm really happy that I met them and because of that I told myself that I'll keep them. <sup>10</sup>
	In this age of mine, I'm thinking more about my future. <sup>11</sup>
	Am I going to be succesful? <sup>12</sup>
	Am I gonna achieve my dream to travel? <sup>13</sup>
	Can I now spoil the people that I love (mostly my family who were there for me)? <sup>14</sup>
	Before having my own family, I want to be stable in life first. <sup>15</sup>
	I want to help my parents, I want to stop them from doing work. <sup>16</sup>
	I want to provide their needs. <sup>17</sup>
	I'm really lucky having them as my parents. <sup>18</sup>
	And I would love to take care of them as they took care of me over the years. <sup>19</sup>
	Two more years and I'll be graduating and hopefully I can find my own job. <sup>20</sup>
